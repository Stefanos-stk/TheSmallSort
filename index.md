# Project Description:

The goal of this project is to attempt to understand what is happening right now with a specific part of the financial market: car loans. After the collapse of the financial system in 2008, a lot of people have been speculating about the next "big" fall. Even though the pandemic was a serious threat to the markets due to the fiscal measures taken (printing more money), a calamity was probably avoided or just postponed.

Using both financial housing data from 2000-2010 (such as debt deliquency rates, interest rates,.. etc) as well as new data about the car loan sector, I hope to build a NN that learns from the housing crash of 2008 and hopefully transfer that knowledge to the auto debt market.

# Some reasons why I chose the auto loan market:
- More than 85% of new cars are financed
- Borrowers under 30 are struggling with their car loans
- Subprime Auto Loans in the US Market saw growth in 2021
- Demand for auto-loans is back in pre-pandemic levels
- Auto Debt Climbs to Record High of $1.37 Trillion 

# Goals:
- Locate and collect correct datasets for both housing and auto loan market 
- Train a NN to recognize and learn "what happened" in 2008
- Apply the model on the auto loan data
- Experiment with different inputs while training (interest rates,deliquencies,market size,securities,...etc)

# Obstacles:
- I don't know much about econ/finance 
- A lot of datasets avaialable 
- How can we measure our results?
